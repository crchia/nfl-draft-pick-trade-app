## Site

## Notes on the Tool
* I used the pick-value-chart listed [here](https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart.asp). A differnt chart could easily be substituted
* Saved Trades will persist until they are deleted, or until the page is refreshed
  * I did not use a database + backend for this small project, hence the saved trades being wiped on refresh. In a full version of this tool, I would add a backend
* Saved Trades can be modified by clicking on the trade
* Dark/Light Mode can be toggled using the button in the top-right corner of the page
